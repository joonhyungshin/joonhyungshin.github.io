I am an undergraduate student in MathSci (Mathematical Sciences) and SoC (School of Computing), KAIST.

I am mostly interested in many topics in discrete mathematics, such as combinatorics, graph theory, and discrete geometry.

Currently, I am working at [Hyperconnect](https://hyperconnect.com/?lang=en) as Data Scientist, whereby I alternatively serve in the military.
