_If you are looking for my Tistory blog written in Korean, [follow this link](https://tistory.joonhyung.xyz/)._

I am a fourth year undergraduate student of mathematics and computer science at KAIST.

I am interested in combinatorics, discrete mathematics, topology, and geometry.

I also enjoy [competitive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming)!
