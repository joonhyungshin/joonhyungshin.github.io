_If you are looking for my Tistory blog written in Korean, [follow this link](https://tistory.joonhyung.xyz/)._

I am an undergraduate student in MathSci (Mathematical Sciences) and SoC (School of Computing), KAIST.

I am interested in connections between mathematics and computer science, but from a mathematical and theoretical perspective.
These include graph theory, discrete geometry, topological methods in combinatorics, etc.
