_If you are looking for my Tistory blog written in Korean, [follow this link](https://tistory.joonhyung.xyz/)._

I am a fourth year undergraduate student of mathematics and computer science at KAIST.

I am interested in connections between mathematics and computer science, but from a mathematical and theoretical perspective.
These include graph theory, discrete geometry, probabilistic and topological methods in combinatorics, etc.

I also enjoy [competitive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming).
