The following problem is about the exchange of two bases of a vector space.

_**Problem**. Let \\(\mathcal{B}\\) and \\(\mathcal{B'}\\) be bases of a finite dimensional vector space \\(V\\).
Let \\(k\\) be an integer with \\(1\leq k\leq \dim(V)\\). Choose any \\(k\\)-element subset \\(X\\) of \\(\mathcal{B}\\).
Can we choose a \\(k\\)-element subset \\(Y\\) of \\(\mathcal{B'}\\) so that after exchanging \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\),
\\(\mathcal{B}\\) and \\(\mathcal{B'}\\) are still bases of \\(V\\)?_

This problem is formulated in terms of linear algebra, but tackling it is not as easy as basic linear algebra.
In fact, even restricting to a specific case \\(V=\mathbb{R}\\) does not make much difference.

Perhaps it may be helpful if we set \\(k=1\\) and observe what happens.
